# KCF-Convoy: efficient Python package to convert KCF chemical substructure fingerprints
KCF-Convoy is a new Python package to generate KCF formats and KCF-S fingerprints from Molfile, SDF, SMILES and InChI seamlessly. Obtained KCF-S were applied to a series of machine learning binary classification methods to distinguish herbicides from other pes- ticides, and also to find characteristic substructures in a specific genus.
