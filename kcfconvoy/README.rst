KCF-Convoy: efficient Python package to convert KCF chemical substructure fingerprints
======================================================================================

| KCF-Convoy is a new Python package to generate KCF formats and KCF-S
  fingerprints from Molfile, SDF, SMILES and InChI seamlessly.
| Obtained KCF-S were applied to a series of machine learning binary
  classification methods to distinguish herbicides from other pes-
  ticides, and also to find characteristic substructures in a specific
  genus.
